# BDwarfLumFunction
The work done here attempts to produce the luminosity function for a subset of brown dwarf candidates from GAIAEDR3. The BD candidate subset was obtained by applying constraints to the GAIA Catalogue of Nearby Stars (GCNS). This procedure based off the work done by the GAIA Collaboration and summarized in "Gaia Early Data Release 3: The Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars." Using a similar procedure, I compare the GCNS BD candidate luminosity function to a BD candidate luminosity function obtained from the "Catalogue of M, L, & T Dwarfs from PAN-STARRS1 3pi Survey" (Best+, 2018).
