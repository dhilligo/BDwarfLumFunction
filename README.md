# BDwarfLumFunction
The work done here attempts to produce the luminosity function for a subset of brown dwarf candidates from GAIAEDR3. The BD candidate subset was obtained by applying constraints to the GAIA Catalogue of Nearby Stars (GCNS). This procedure based off the work done by the GAIA Collaboration and summarized in "Gaia Early Data Release 3: The Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars." (GAIA Collaboration+ et al. 2020) I then compare this GAIA Data to combined brown dwarf models produced by Marley et al. 2021 and Fernandes et al. 2019. Models produced by Filippazzo et al. 2015 were used to derive a relationship between absolute bolometric magnitude and absolute GAIA G-band magnitude which was then applied to our combined model from Marley et al. 2021 and Fernandes et al. 2019.
